# Welcome to Hao Zhang's Personal Website

This is the homepage of Hao Zhang, a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. I am passionate about robotics, embedded systems, and human-robot interaction. Below you will find more information about my academic background, research experience, and projects.

## About Me

I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati and Chongqing University (as part of a 4+1 program), achieving academic excellence with a GPA of 3.64/4.0. My current research interests include upgrading robotic systems, developing human-robot interfaces, and implementing control systems for rehabilitation robots.

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the ModLab of the GRASP Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Prof. Mark Yim, where I focus on upgrading the SMORES robot and building simulations. Additionally, I contribute to the Little Flo Robot project at the Rehabilitation Robotics Lab, improving robotic systems for patient rehabilitation.
